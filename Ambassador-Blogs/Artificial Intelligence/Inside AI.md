# Inside Artificial Intelligence (AI)

AI Generally means machines having ability to perform human like tasks and in some ways even better than humans. Today, AI is taking world by storm from ChatGPT for generating text to DALLE-2 and Stable Diffusion for Image Generation. These AI tools are further used for developing many AI products like Bing AI, GitHub Copilot, etc. AI is being used in various industries from autonomous self-driving cars to medical. And as the research and development moves new use cases are being discovered.

So, what exactly are these AI? Well, they are just a bunch of Artificial Neural Networks trained on good quality data. This method is called Deep Learning.

## Machine Learning VS Deep Learning

Both Machine Learning and Deep Learning has similar process but there are some key differences between machine learning and deep learning. That are:

- Machine learning can train on smaller data sets while deep learning requires large amounts of data.
- Machine learning requires more human intervention to correct and learn while deep learning learns on its own from environment and past mistakes.
- Machine learning has shorter training and lower accuracy while deep learning has longer training and higher accuracy.
- Machine learning makes simple, linear correlations while deep learning makes non-linear, complex correlations.
- Machine learning can train on a CPU (central processing unit) while deep learning needs a specialized GPU (graphics processing unit) to train.

The Above image represents an Artificial Neural Network (aka Deep Neural Network), The Input Layer takes in the data, the Hidden layer build up the pattern and the Output Layer shows the prediction.

There are many different neural network architectures for different uses like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's) are commonly used for image classification and computer vision tasks. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN's) are effective for generative task such as image synthesis, Transformer-based models like once used in natural language processing have significant advancements in tasks like machine translation and text generation.

You can create these Neural Networks using some of the best libraries and frameworks like Pytorch, TensorFlow, Keras, etc with Python. And for training and remaining processes I would recommend you use a cloud environment like Azure Machine Learning Studios as most often the dataset used is very large we can use cloud to store our data and it also provide access to multiple GPU's. Azure Machine Learning studio contains all the essential tools that a data scientist requires.

If you are really interested in AI and Deep Learning, I would highly recommend you go through these courses:

- [Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
- [Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction)
- [Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization by Luis Serrano](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science)

## Cognitive Services

You can also use Azure Cognitive Services, they are cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) services that help developers build cognitive intelligence into applications without having direct AI or data science skills or knowledge. They are available through REST APIs and client library SDKs in popular development languages.

Cognitive Services brings AI within reach of every developer and data scientist. With leading models, a variety of use cases can be unlocked. All it takes is an API call to embed the ability to see, hear, speak, search, understand, and accelerate advanced decision-making into your apps.
