GitHub is a git service on cloud. So, you can basically perform version control and store your code on internet. More then that you can even showcase some of your best works as a developer. You can also collaborate in a team project on GitHub. Many Open-source projects are hosted on GitHub and anyone can contribute to them.


## Hosting Your Code

Hosting a code file is very easy and there are 3 methods to do that:

- Using Git Commands
- Using GitHub Desktop
- Using VS Code extension

There are 2 types of repositories to store files on GitHub:

- **Public Repo's** – Complete program file is publicly available, anyone with access to internet can go through them. They are used when anyone wants to make their project open source Or to Showcase them to HR during an interview.

- **Private Repo's** – The files are only accessible by the owner, no one except them can access it without their permission. You can use them when you just want to store your program or work in a team privately.

## GitHub Pages

When you just started to work in web development, after creating a really nice web page you feel like you need to show it to everyone but you can't carry your laptop everywhere. In that case it's time to move from "localhost" to "{Your\_project}. github.io" .

All you must do is:
### add the source code to GitHub -\> Repo's Settings -\> Pages -\> Select the Branch -\> Save

Once you save, it will be deployed. You can check your web page's deployment status under GitHub Actions. GitHub Actions is a platform for automating CI/CD pipelines.

## GitHub Codespaces

Now we can use VS Code in any device with GitHub Codespaces. Suppose If you want to make minor changes to your code. Instead of cloning the entire repo just for few changes, you can open the repo in codespaces then make changes and commit it.

Not only that it already has some of the widely used quickstart template like react js, next js, etc. So you can work on your project from start to finish on GitHub without installing anything locally.

It also provides multiple machine type to run your project. That's why it's good to perform data science tasks with jupyter-notebook.

## GitHub Copilot

We know that AI is taking the world by storm. And there are many different AI for different tasks. And for a Developer, GitHub Copilot is like a partner who help boost their productivity by suggesting code and recently GitHub added a new feature to Copilot that enables the developers to chat with the copilot and it can also explain the code you are working on.

## GitHub Student Developer Pack

One of the best things a computer science student can ask for is GitHub Student Developer Pack. Some of the widely used tool that a developer needs are paid or needs subscription and many students can't afford that. And that's why GitHub partnered with some them to provide the students with those tools to educate themselves and on top of that, there are some of the amazing courses from top professional in the field.

It also provides GitHub Pro. So you can use GitHub Pages with private repo's, 180 core hours and 20 GB storage for Codespaces, access to GitHub Community Exchange, etc.

All you need is your email id provided by your College/University. Make sure it has your College/University domain at the end.
