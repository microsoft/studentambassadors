# Getting Started with Prototype Sprints

### Instructions for All Team Leads
1. Creating a GitHub Repository for your team (ensure the repo has a README) file. 
2. Navigate to your repository's Settings > Manage Access. Then Select Add People and add your team members as collaborators
3. Navigate to your Repository's Projects Tab and select "New Project." Give your project a name and a description. For the Template, select Basic Kanban. This will give you a project board with 3 categories, "To-Do," "In Progress," and "Done."
4. Ensure your team is familiarized with GitHub Projects by visiting the [GitHub Projects Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards)
5. Ensure your team is familiarized with Writing and formatting syntax by visiting the [Basic writing and formatting syntax Documentation](https://github.github.com/gfm/)

### Instructions for All Teams
1. Create 3 markdown files in your project's GitHub Repository: "Problem Research," "Solution Identification," and "Prototype."
2. Throughout Month 1, your team should identify a problem for which you want to create a solution. Details about how you chose your problem should be included in the "Problem Research" file. Team Leads should work with team members to define relevant tasks and assign them to team members on GitHub Projects.
3. Throughout Month 2, teams should work together to identify potential solutions, and choose the most promising one. Details about solutions that the team considered and why you chose the one you did should be included in the "Solution Identification" file.
4. Throughout Month 3, teams should work together to build their technical prototype. Details about your prototype should be included on the "Prototype" file. Team Leads should use GitHub projects to assign tasks to team members to build the prototype. 
5. Feel free to add any additional files necessary for your prototype.
