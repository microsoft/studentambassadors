# Hello Student Ambassador reviewers

In this first Learning Path, you'll be running C# code samples in the Web browser using a tool known as **Try .NET**.

Microsoft has implemented **Try .NET** in the MS Learn environment to make it easier for anyone to learn how to code. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to integrate **Try .NET** with the content for this review process.

Instead, we ask you to use **Try .NET** in one window while you review the training content using a second window. We realize that this is not ideal, sorry. Once we publish the training to the MS Learn platform, the **Try .NET** tool will open in the same window as the learning content.

## Prepare your environment

1. Use the following link to open a C# tutorial that uses the **Try .NET** tool: [https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/hello-world](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/hello-world)

    You should see a Web page with the title **Hello World - Introduction to C# interactive C# tutorial**

1. At the bottom of the page, click **Begin ->**.

1. The following page should be displayed.

1. Notice the .NET Editor area that's displayed on the right side of the browser window.

    This is the **Try .NET** tool that you will be using to run code samples during this first Learning Path.

1. Resize the browser window so that it's aligned to the right side and takes up about 3/4 of the screen.

1. Switch back to the GitHub window that you're using to review the training content for this first Learning Path.

1. Resize the GitHub window on the left side of the screen so that it hides the left half of the browser window as follows:

1. Ensure that you can switch back-and-forth between the two windows.

    The training content provides instructions for entering code into the .NET Editor. We realize that switching between the two windows is a bit clunky. Please use the two windows to follow the instructions and run the code samples as best as you can. Thanks for your patience and your review feedback.
