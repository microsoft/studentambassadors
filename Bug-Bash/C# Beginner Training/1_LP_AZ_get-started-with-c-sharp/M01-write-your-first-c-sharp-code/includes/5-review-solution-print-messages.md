The following code is one possible solution for the challenge from the previous unit.

```c#
Console.WriteLine("This is the first line.");

Console.Write("This is ");
Console.Write("the second ");
Console.Write("line.");
```

This code is merely *one possible solution*, because we didn't specify which technique to apply to which line of output. However, you should have used both the `Console.WriteLine()` and `Console.Write()` methods to produce the desired output.

```Output
This is the first line.
This is the second line.
```

If you were successful, congratulations! Continue to the knowledge check in the next unit.
