Our goal is to write code that will display simple messages to an output console, and in doing so, become familiar with the syntax. We wrote our first lines of code using basic C# syntax. We learned two techniques for displaying literal-string data to the console. We learned what to look for when we come across an error in our code. And lastly, we identified C# syntax elements like classes and methods, and the purpose of several special symbols that are known as operators.

Congratulations on taking your first steps to building more sophisticated applications.
