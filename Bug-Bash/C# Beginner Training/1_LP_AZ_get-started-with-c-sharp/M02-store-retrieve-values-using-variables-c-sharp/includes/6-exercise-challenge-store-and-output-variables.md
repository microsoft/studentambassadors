In this challenge, you'll write code that will combine literal and variable values into a single message.

### Step 1: Delete all of the code in the .NET Editor from the earlier exercise

Select all of the code in the .NET Editor then select the `del` or backspace key to delete it.

### Step 2: Write code in the .NET Editor to display a message

When you're finished, the message should resemble the following output:

```Output
Hello, Bob! You have 3 in your inbox. The temperature is 34.4 celsius.
```

Store the following values from the output in variables:

- Bob
- 3
- 34.4

These variables should be given names that reflect their purpose.

Make sure you select the correct data type for each of the variables based on the type of data it will hold.

Finally, you'll combine the variables with literal strings passed into a series of `Console.Write()` commands to form the complete message.
