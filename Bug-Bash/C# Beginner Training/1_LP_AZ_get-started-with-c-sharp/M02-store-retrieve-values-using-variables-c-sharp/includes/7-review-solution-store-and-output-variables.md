The following code is one possible solution for the challenge from the previous unit.

```c#
string name = "Bob";
int messages = 3;
decimal temperature = 34.4m;

Console.Write("Hello, ");
Console.Write(name);
Console.Write("! You have ");
Console.Write(messages);
Console.Write(" in your inbox. The temperature is ");
Console.Write(temperature);
Console.Write(" celsius.");
```

This code is merely "*one possible solution*" because we didn't specify exactly how to create the output. For example, it's possible you could have used more `Console.Write()` statements; however, you should have initialized three variables to store the three values per the instructions in the challenge.

Furthermore, you should have used:

- a variable of type `string` to hold the name `"Bob"`.
- a variable of type `int` to store the number of messages.
- a variable of type `decimal` to store the temperature.

If you were successful, congratulations! Continue on to the knowledge check in the next unit.
