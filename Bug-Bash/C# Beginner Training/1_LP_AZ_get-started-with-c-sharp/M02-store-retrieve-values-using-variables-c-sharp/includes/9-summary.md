Our goal was to display a formatted message using a combination of literal and variable values.

Using basic C# syntax, we created literal values of several different data types. We declared variables, then set and retrieved values from those variables. We initialized variables, and learned how to use the `var` keyword to implicitly type a variable by inferring the type from the initialization.

Congratulations on taking another step towards to building more sophisticated applications.
