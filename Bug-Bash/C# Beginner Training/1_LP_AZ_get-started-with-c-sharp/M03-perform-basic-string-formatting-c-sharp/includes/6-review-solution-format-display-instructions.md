The following code is one possible solution for the challenge from the previous unit.

```c#
string projectName = "ACME";
string englishLocation = $@"c:\Exercise\{projectName}\data.txt";
Console.WriteLine($"View English output:\n\t\t{englishLocation}\n");
            
string russianMessage = "\u041f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u044b\u0432\u043e\u0434";
string russianLocation = $@"c:\Exercise\{projectName}\ru-RU\data.txt";
Console.WriteLine($"{russianMessage}:\n\t\t{russianLocation}\n");

```

This code is merely "*one possible solution*". You may have some variation in naming variables or in the character escape sequences you used. You may have used `Console.Write()` instead of `Console.WriteLine()`. You may have attempted to combine everything together without using several variables.

However, as long as your code follows the instructions from the challenge and produces the desired output, then congratulations! Continue on to the knowledge check in the next unit.
