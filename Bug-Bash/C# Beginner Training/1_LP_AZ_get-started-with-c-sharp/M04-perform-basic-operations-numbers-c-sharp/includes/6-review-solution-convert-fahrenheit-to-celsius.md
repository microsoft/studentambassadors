The following code is one possible solution for the challenge from the previous unit.

```c#
int fahrenheit = 94;
decimal celsius = (fahrenheit - 32m) * (5m / 9m);
Console.WriteLine("The temperature is " + celsius + " Celsius.");

```

This code is merely "*one possible solution*" because we didn't specify exactly how to create the output.

If you were successful, congratulations! Continue on to the knowledge check in the next unit.
