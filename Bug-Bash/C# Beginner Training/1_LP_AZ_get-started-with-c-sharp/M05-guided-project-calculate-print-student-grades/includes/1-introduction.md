Developers perform some tasks nearly every day. Tasks including declaring string and numeric variables, assigning and extracting values, and performing calculations are routine, but essential. Equally important is the task of communicating results to the application user. Mastering the ability to apply these skills to solve a given problem is something that every developer must learn to do.

## Example scenario

Suppose you are a teacher's assistant at a school. You've been tasked with developing an application that will automate student grading. The application will use all of the scored assignments for each student to calculate their current overall grade/score for the class. The teacher has also provided a required format for reporting the student grades.

## What will we be doing?

This module will guide you through the steps required to develop your Student Grading application. Your code will declare and assign values to variables based on student names, perform various numeric calculations, and display the results. Calculations will include determining the sum of assignment scores and calculating the current grade for each student. To display the results in the required format, you will need to use WriteLine() methods, as well character escape sequences that help to format your results.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you will be able to write code that uses various variable types, performs numeric calculations, and displays formatted data for the user.
