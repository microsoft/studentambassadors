You'll be using the .NET Editor as your code development environment. You will be writing code that uses string and numeric variables, performs calculations, then formats and displays the results to a console.

## Project overview

You are developing a Student GPA Calculator that will help students calculate their overall Grade Point Average. The parameters for your application are:

- You are given the student's name and class information.
- Each class has a name, the student's grade, and the number of credit hours for that class.
- Your application needs to perform basic math operations to calculate the GPA for the given student.
- Your application needs to output/display student’s name, class information, and GPA.

To calculate the GPA:
- Multiply the grade value for a course by the number of credit hours for that course
- Do this for each course, then add these results together
- Divide the resulting sum by the total number of credit hours

We are provided with the following sample of a student's course information and GPA:

```Output
Student: Sophia Johnson

Course			Grade	Credit Hours
English 101			4		3
Algebra 101			3		3
Biology 101			3		4
Computer Science I	3		4
Psychology 101		4		3

Final GPA:			3.35
```

## Setup

Use the following steps to prepare for the Challenge project exercises.

1. Open the .NET Editor coding environment.

1. Copy and paste the following code into the .NET Editor. These values represent the student's name and course details.

```c#
string studentName = "Sophia Johnson";
string course1Name = "English 101";
string course2Name = "Algebra 101";
string course3Name = "Biology 101";
string course4Name = "Computer Science I";
string course5Name = "Psychology 101";

int course1Credit = 3;
int course2Credit = 3;
int course3Credit = 4;
int course4Credit = 4;
int course5Credit = 3;
```

You are now ready to begin the Challenge project exercises. Good luck!
