The C# programming language is supplemented by a large library of functionality that enables you to create desktop or web applications, access data in files or on the internet, perform advanced mathematical operations, and much more. Understanding how to navigate this library of functionality is a critical skill that will help you build feature-rich applications more quickly.

Suppose you need to generate a few random numbers that correspond to a subset of files on your hard drive containing data so you can sample the data and return an approximate result without analyzing all the data files. How can you generate a random number? Is this supported by C#? If so, how can you write code to limit the random number, generate it, and retrieve the result?

In this module, you'll write code that calls methods in the .NET Class Library. You'll learn why methods are designed and implemented differently across the .NET Class Library. Most importantly, you'll write code to pass information into methods and retrieve information returned by methods. Finally, you'll use built-in tools and online documentation to help you gather information about the methods you want to work with.

By the end of this module, you'll know how to find and use methods on classes in the .NET Class Library to help you perform many common tasks.

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you will:

- Write code that calls methods in the .NET Class Library
- Create a new instance of .NET Class Library classes to call methods that maintain state
- Use Intellisense to learn more about a method, including its overloaded versions, its return value type, and its input parameter data types
- Use docs.microsoft.com to research what a method does, its overloaded versions, its return value type, its input parameters and what each parameter represents, and more

## Prerequisites

- Experience declaring, initializing, setting, and retrieving values in variables
- Experience using the basic C# data types including `int` and `string`
- Experience using the method `Console.WriteLine()`
