Our goal in this module was to add branching logic to our code by using decision statements.

Using `if`, `else`, and `else if` statements, we evaluated one or more Boolean expressions to change the execution path of our application. This allowed us to execute some code and ignore other code, depending on some condition. Without decision statements, our applications would lack the ability to automate common business, gaming, and scientific tasks required in modern applications.

We'll come to rely on the techniques we learned in this module in virtually every application we build.

There are two other ways to introduce decision logic into our application. We'll introduce the `switch` statement and the conditional operator in other modules.
