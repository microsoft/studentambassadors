Our goal was to write code that is easily readable and understandable.

We used variable naming conventions to improve the readability of our code. Camel case helps us identify a local variable as opposed to other identifiers in our code. It also gives us a way to use multiple words that describe the purpose of a given variable to the reader. We used code comments to temporarily remove code that we want to rewrite before deleting. But we also used code comments to add more meaningful explanations of its higher-level purpose in the system. Finally, we used whitespace judiciously to help improve the readability of our code.

We saw how the compiler doesn't care how we write the code. But since we'll write the code once, but read the code many times, improving readability will help us maintain and support our code long term.
