Our goal was to build an application that uses a combination of iteration and selection statements to process the contents of arrays and achieve the design goals of our application.

By creating a nested combination of `foreach` and `if` statements, we built an application that processes the contents of student name and assignment score arrays to calculate and report student grades. The application logic supports adding additional students and assignment scores with minimal code updates.

Having the ability to implement nested iteration statements that process array data, and selection statements that branch the code execution path, enables you to create more efficient and extensible code.
