When adding decision logic to your application, you'll need to evaluate many different kinds of conditions. To express those conditions adequately, you'll need to have a full complement of operators.

Suppose you need to determine whether one value is greater, equal to, or less than another value. Or, what if you need to ensure a user's input matches a specific value. Or, what if you need to make sure the value returned from a method does not indicate a failure.

To satisfy these cases, you will use many different kinds of Boolean expressions and a wide array of operators.

In this module, you'll learn about Boolean expressions, and use many different operators and techniques to test values for equality, inequality, and comparison. Finally, you'll also learn how to use a special inline version of an `if` statement called the conditional operator for an "either / or" result.

By the end of this module, you'll be writing code that can more fully express your intent as you develop decision logic in your applications.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Use operators to create Boolean expressions that test for comparison and equality.
- Use built-in methods of the string class to perform better evaluations on strings.
- Use the negation operator to test for the opposite of a given condition.
- Use the conditional operator to perform an inline evaluation.

## Prerequisites:

- Experience with basic coding tasks such as instantiating variables, using various data types, and sending output to a console window.
- Experience using the `if-elseif-else` construct.
- Experience using the `Random` class to generate a random number.
- Experience using Visual Studio Code to create and run simple console applications.
