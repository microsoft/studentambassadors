Our goal was to add branching logic that matches one variable or expression against many possible values.

Using the `switch-case` construct, we matched an employee's numeric level with their title. We used the `switch-case` as a replacement for the `if-elseif-else` construct to more succinctly express our intent of converting a Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) into a long-form description.

The `if-elseif-else` decision statement, the `switch-case` decision statement, and conditional operator provide three ways to branch our code logic. You now know how to choose the best C# tool for expressing your intent in your code.
