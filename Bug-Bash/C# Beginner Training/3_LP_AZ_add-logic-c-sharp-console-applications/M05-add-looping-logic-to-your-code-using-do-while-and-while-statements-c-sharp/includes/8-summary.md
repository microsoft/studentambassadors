Our goal was to use the `do-while` and `while` statements to perform an iteration. As we learned, what makes the `do` and `while` statements unique is how the body of the code block determines whether the flow of execution should continue or stop.

Using the `do-while` statement, we executed a block of code once before evaluating a Boolean expression and potentially exiting the iteration. Using the `while` statement, we performed the evaluation of the Boolean expression immediately, and continued to evaluate it to exit the iteration. We used the `continue` statement to step directly to the Boolean expression.

Built a practical example that utilized the `do-while` and `continue` statements to simulate a battle in a role playing game. Other real-world scenarios involving the `do-while` and `while` iteration statements involve working with streams of data from files, from the internet, or any other scenario where we'll continue to perform an iteration until a condition is met.

If you've been following along in the modules in this learning path, we hope you're gaining confidence in both your knowledge of C# and your ability to apply your new programming language skills to solving problems.
