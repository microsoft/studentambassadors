In this module, we used helper methods to use arrays more effectively. We used several helper methods to sort and reverse the order of the data in arrays. We cleared out the items in the array and learned how cleared elements are set to null. We resized the array add and remove elements. We converted a string into an array by splitting it into smaller based on a delimiter -- for example, a character like a space or a comma. We also split a string into an array of characters so we could reverse their order. Finally, we joined all of the elements of the array into a single string.

The array helper methods allowed us to work flexibly with data in our applications. Without these features, arrays would be less useful.

Later, we'll learn about special classes in the .NET Class Library called collections, which provide even more functionality than arrays. We'll also learn about a special feature of C# and the .NET Class Library called LINQ that allows us to query, filter, sort, and aggregate data in arrays and collections, which will provide even more flexibility and utility.
