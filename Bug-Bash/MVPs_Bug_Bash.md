# Microsoft Valuable Professionals Bug Bashes - Providing Feedback
This doc contains the instructions for how to participate in the Microsoft Valuable Professionals Bug Bashes as well as the space to report any feedback or issues discovered.

**[Create an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/studentambassadors/issues) on this repository for each new issue you want to report.** Choose the "üêûReport a Bug!" option when creating a new issue.

## What is AI Kick-off Challenges? ü§ñ
Every learner wants to showcase their skills through a portfolio-worthy project. Most of the content available is ‚ÄúHow-to‚Äù kind of tutorials which guides our audience step by step to achieve a goal. While this is part of the learning process, it is not enough to challenge them. AI Kick-off challenges initiative is our response to this need, coming from our customers‚Äô feedback.
The collection includes:
- **3 AI kick-off projects** - targeted to *developers building apps with AI*. AI services included: GitHub Copilot, Azure OpenAI service, Azure AI Vision, Azure AI Speech
- **3 Gen AI for innovators challenges** - targeted to *entrepreneurs looking to build their MVP/business model with Gen AI*. AI services included: Bing Chat

## What is a Bug Bash? üïµÔ∏è
A Bug Bash is a cross-team effort where everyone aims to find as many bugs as possible. A cross-functional team is important to test from a variety of perspectives and in different ways. 

We want to understand the following:
- While you go through the challenge is there anything confusing or unclear in the project specification?
- What errors and issues are you encountering, if any?
- Do you see this collection of projects as a good next step after completing the MVP AI Bootcamp based on the OSS repo [Gen AI for beginners](https://aka.ms/genai-beginners)?
- Do you feel more comfortable in the skills you acquired with the MVP AI Bootcamp after completing the AI Kick-off Challenges?

Our goal is to improve the usability of this AI project collection for you. A diversity of perspectives is important to finding as many bugs as possible and sharing ideas for feature enhancements and making an improvement in your experience (and for other developers like you).

## Why should I participate or provide feedback? ü§î
We've heard that you want to develop technical skills, help and empower others to learn and grow and contribute to the community. Providing product feedback and reporting issues via this Bug Bash can help you do just that.

- Reviewing these materials will not only help you further develop your technical skills, but it will also provide a better learning experience for others.
- Help us understand how we should continue to run Bug Bashes in the future! Participate in this pilot to help us determine additional, effective ways to allow you the opportunity to provide us with product feedback and get exposure to the process and the product teams we work with to resolve outstanding issues.

## Tips for Providing Feedback üêû
When you encounter a challenge, issue or bug, consider the following when [logging your issue]((https://github.com/microsoft/studentambassadors/issues)):
- What issue/challenge did I encounter?
- What steps did I take to encounter this challenge/issue? How would I reproduce it?
- What is the outcome or behavior that I am expecting?
- Why is this an issue or challenge for you?
- How does it impact your activities/task at hand?
- What is your current workaround?

We recommend that you review the materials that you think less individuals will choose - it's a great way to find the bugs no one else has already found and increase your exposure opportunities with Microsoft.

Have fun bug bashing!
