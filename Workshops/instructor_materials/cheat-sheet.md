# Workshop Cheat Sheet

Here are the steps to take to create and host a workshop:

## Creation phase

1.  Clone this repo and edit the files indicated below to build your workshop, removing others as necessary.
1.  Decide whether you want to create a **new** workshop or use an **existing** workshop.
1. For an **existing** workshop, skip to the logistics section.
1. For a **new** workshop, walk through the questions in the [workshop designer](../template/workshop-designer.md) file, documenting your plans for the workshop.
1. Build the workshop using the [lesson template](../template/README.md) files.
1. Build slides as a preliminary presentation to explain the desired outcomes of the workshop.
1. When you think the workshop is ready for inclusion into the library, please send a pull request to the [workshop library](../workshop_library/README.md) using the PR template. A reviewer will be assigned to the workshop and will work with you to perfect it.

## Logistics phase

1. Invite your students to the workshop held on Teams Live, optionally using text from your [workshop designer](../template/workshop-designer.md) file to explain expected student takeaways. You can use [this template](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEuDXXR9us/EdQZLkVpknPAzSRD4fSxyw/view?utm_content=DAEuDXXR9us&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton&mode=preview) to design a poster about your session.
1. Gather your group of mentors and assign them groups of students if you have a larger group of students to teach. Meet with the mentors prior to the workshop, and walk through the suggested [mentor training](https://github.com/FrontEndFoxes/art/blob/main/frontend-foxes-mentor-training.pdf)

## Delivery phase

1. Hold the workshop on Teams Live, **keeping count of attendees**.
1. Start with slides, giving a presentation to introduce yourself and explain what students will discover.
1. After the presentation, walk through the [workshop](../template/README.md) files, explaining the milestones.

## Feedback phase 

1. Ask students in the workshop to fill out [this survey](https://forms.office.com/r/MdhJWMZthR), linked at the bottom of the workshop page. 
1. Fill in a [survey to catalogue your own experiences](https://forms.office.com/r/thfwmD0USG) as a workshop instructor using this form.
1. Log your activity via the MLSA program tools.
1. Report back any feedback from the workshop, including your experience as a teacher, your mentors' experiences, and any suggestions from any participant on to improve the workshop.

Have fun!
