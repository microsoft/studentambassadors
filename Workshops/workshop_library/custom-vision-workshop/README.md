# Build a Machine Learning Model

## Overview

In this workshop you will use Python to explore AI with custom vision. Custom vision is a service which can be used to categorize images.

| **Project Goal**              | Learn about Custom Vision AI and how to use it to train and test images                                    |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What will you learn**       | Use images to train a model to be able to perform inference to classify images                                        |
| **What you'll need**          | Python 3.8+, Visual Studio Code |
| **Duration**                  | 1 hour                                                                |
| **Just want to try the app or see the solution?** | [Solution](./solution)                         |

## Prerequisites

### Python 3.8 or greater, including pip

To test if you have Python and pip installed, open a command or terminal window and run the following commands.

```bash
python3 --version
pip3 --version
```

If Python and pip are installed a version number will be displayed, such as *3.8.10*. Otherwise, an error message is displayed. You can install Python and pip as needed:

- [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/python/beginners#install-python)
- [MacOS](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/)
- [Linux](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-linux-tools/)

### Visual Studio Code

The instructions for this workshop assume you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), an open source code editor. You will also need the [Pylance extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance), which will provide additional functionality when writing Python.
